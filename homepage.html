    <h1>Computer Hardware</h1>
    <br>
            <p>Computer hardware is the physical part of a computer . Generally ,  hardware is referred to as computer equipment and is distinguished from software .
                This division is blurred because many modern computer hardware components have built-in software called firmware ,
                which is an integral part of the hardware and without which they would not be able to function. For example ,
                most computer printers have a set of commands stored in their memory that they use to perform the printing process,and their
                equivalents reside in the computer's memoryas the device's software driver .

A central processing unit ( CPU ) is a sequential digital device that retrieves data from main memory or a data stream, interprets it, and executes it as instructions , returning data to memory or an output data stream. The term is narrowly used to refer to the central processing unit (CPU) of a system, but it also refers to other data processing elements called coprocessors, such as floating-point units and graphics processing units ( GPUs

A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed for digital image processing and to accelerate computer graphics, being present either as a component on a discrete graphics card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. GPUs were later found to be useful for non-graphic calculations involving embarrassingly parallel problems due to their parallel structure. The ability of GPUs to rapidly perform vast numbers of calculations has led to their adoption in diverse fields including artificial intelligence (AI) where they excel at handling data-intensive and computationally demanding tasks
