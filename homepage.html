    <h1>Computer Hardware</h1>
    <br>
            <p>Computer hardware is the physical part of a computer . Generally ,  hardware is referred to as computer equipment and is distinguished from software .
                This division is blurred because many modern computer hardware components have built-in software called firmware ,
                which is an integral part of the hardware and without which they would not be able to function. For example ,
                most computer printers have a set of commands stored in their memory that they use to perform the printing process,and their
                equivalents reside in the computer's memoryas the device's software driver .</p>

            <tr>
                <th>Operating systems</th>
                    <td>A system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, 
                        and provides common services for computer programs. 
                        Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system. 
                        It may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, peripherals, and other resources.</td>
                <th>Application software</th>
                        <td>A software that is intended for end-user use, not operating, administering or programming a computer.
                             An application (app, application program, software application) is any program that can be categorized as application software.
                              Application is a subjective classification that is often used to differentiate from system and utility software.</td>
